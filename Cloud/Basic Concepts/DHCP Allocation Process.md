## DHCP ALLOCATION PROCESS
The **DHCP allocation process** is actually one of the easiest ways to understand how the client-server model works in the real world.<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">It all starts when a device (the **client**) joins a network and needs an IP address to communicate. Since it doesnâ€™t have one yet, it sends out a **DHCP Discover** which is a **broadcast message** that includes its **MAC address**, basically asking, If there is any DHCP server out there that can help me get an **IP address**?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Any **DHCP server** on the network that receives this will respond with a **DHCP Offer**. This is a message that includes an available **IP address** the client can use, along with some other network details like the subnet mask and default gateway.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">If the client decides to accept the offer (which it usually does), it sends back a **DHCP Request**. But if you're not sure why it rejected it **click here** for my explanation.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">After receiving the **DHCP REQUEST** the **server** sends back a **DHCP ACK (Acknowledgement)** message (packet) which just informs the **client** that it has updated it's records with the parameters sent in the **DHCP OFFER** to the **MAC Address** initially sent in the  **DHCP DISCOVER** message (packet)</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">And just like that, the **client** has everything it needs to start communicating on the network.</p>
