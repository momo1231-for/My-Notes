# **Client-Server Model**
The **client-server model** is at the core of most computer services we use today.<br/>At its simplest, it’s just what the name implies—a client and a server. The client needs something, and the server has (or can provide) that thing.<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">The process usually goes like this: the client sends a request to the server. On a larger scale, this might pass through things like routing and load balancing systems. Once the server gets the request, it processes it—checking things like whether the client is authorized and whether it can actually fulfill the request.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Then it sends back a response. The client receives that response and decides what to do with it.</p>
# **Simple Analogy**
The **client-server model** is like how most online services work—and a good way to understand it is to think of a pizza shop.<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">In this setup, the **client** is like a hungry customer, and the **server** is the pizza shop. The customer wants a pizza, so they place an order (which is the request).</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Now, in a simple case, the order goes straight to the shop. But in a busy city, it might go through different branches (like routing or load balancing) to make sure the order gets to the right location that can handle it fastest.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Once the shop gets the order, they check a few things:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">- Does the customer have an account or has paid? (Authorization)</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"> - Do they have the ingredients and capacity to make the pizza? (Can they fulfill the request?)</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">If everything checks out, the shop makes the pizza and sends it back to the customer—that's the response.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">The customer (client) then receives the pizza and decides what to do next—maybe eat it, share it, or complain if it’s not what they expected.</P>
