## Overview
Authorization (AuthZ) in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) determines what actions are allowed on cloud resources and who is allowed to perform them. Unlike [*authentication (AuthN) in OCI*](https://github.com/momo1231-for/My-Notes/blob/main/Cloud/Oracle/Oracle%20Cloud%20Infrastructure%20(OCI)%20-%20Authentication%20(AuthN).md), which verifies identity, authorization is about permissions and access control. OCI handles AuthZ using a powerful and flexible IAM policy framework that works across compartments, identity domains, and tenancy-wide configurations.
## How OCI Authorization Works
Access control in OCI is policy-driven. Every API call made to a resource is evaluated against the active IAM policies to determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Policies are written in a human-readable format and define what groups can do what actions on which resources, in which compartments.
####  Policy Syntax Simple Example: 
Allow **group DevOps** to **manage instances** in compartment **Project-X**.<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Which means anyone in the DevOps group of users can manage (create, update, delete, or read) compute instances in the Project-X compartment.
## Key Concepts
1. **Policies:** This are text-based rules that define who can access what and at what permission level. They can be written at the **tenancy**, **compartment**, or **domain level**. They use certain verbs as conditions like:.<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">**Inspect** - Which allows a user to only view *metadata*<br/>**Read** - Which allows a user to do everything that can be done with "inspect" and *get the data* but does not allow for interaction.<br/>**Use** - Which allows a user to do everything that can be done with "read" and allows interaction which means connect the resource to other resources but can't actually modify the resource itself.<br/>**Manage** - Which gives full access to a resource.
